SNHU CS370: Current/Emerging Trends in CS

## What code were you given? What code did you create yourself? 

In this project I wrote the code that implements the main loop of the pathfinding training. This code loops for each epoch, starts a new environment with the agent in a random free space, loops until the agent either reaches the goal or hits the minimum value for reward score. Within this loop, code was written which causes the agent to choose its next move based on exploration or exploitation. This ratio changes as the win percentage increases, shifting eventually towards an agent choosing entirely exploitation. Data for each episode is stored and used to train the model.

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? 

As a computer scientist, I will work to create solutions to problems using different techniques and technologies. It is the responsibility of a computer scientist to anticipate the applications of their work and ensure that it is ethical and beneficial. In the field of machine learning and AI, this is especially acute. Care must be given to not only how the model may be used, but how it is initially trained as well.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? 

As a computer scientist, my first step in approaching a problem is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the problem. Jumping to the solution space without truly understanding not only the problem but the circumstances surrounding it will usually cause more problems than they solve.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? 

The ramifications of not considering and adhering to the ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization are numerous. With regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), daunting fines can be imposed for mishandling data. Aside from monetary penalties, we have a duty to protect and maintain the trust of our user base. Once that is lost, it is not easily regained. When working with user data, all legal and best-practice guidelines should be adhered to.
